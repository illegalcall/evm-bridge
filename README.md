# EVM Bridge – Sepolia ETH <-> BSC Testnet
A cross-chain bridge that facilitates transferring **Donut** tokens between the [Sepolia Ethereum test network](https://chainlist.org/chain/11155111) and the [BSC testnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/97). This project includes both a **backend** (smart contracts, relayer, scripts) and a **frontend** (dApp interface) to demonstrate bridging functionality. When bridging **Donut** tokens, you will receive **WDonut** (wrapped Donut) tokens on the destination chain.

## Overview
**EVM Bridge** is designed to allow users to lock **Donut** tokens on one chain and mint a wrapped version (**WDonut**) on the other. The project demonstrates the concept of cross-chain bridging using:

- **Donut** – The primary ERC-20 token.  
- **WDonut** – A wrapped version of Donut that represents your locked tokens on the destination chain.  
- **ETHBridge.sol** – Manages bridging logic on the Sepolia Ethereum network.  
- **BSCBridge.sol** – Manages bridging logic on the Binance Smart Chain testnet.  

The goal is to enable developers to test bridging solutions on test networks before deploying to mainnets.

```
- **evm-bridge-backend** – All backend code including smart contracts, scripts, and configurations for the relayer.  
- **evm-bridge-frontend** – Frontend dApp for interacting with the bridge.  

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)  
2. **npm** or **yarn**  
3. **Hardhat** or **Foundry** (if you are using Hardhat/Foundry to compile and deploy the contracts)  
4. **Metamask** or a similar Web3-enabled wallet (for testing the dApp in a browser)

---

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/evm-bridge.git
   cd evm-bridge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - **Backend**  
     ```bash
     cd evm-bridge-backend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Frontend**  
     ```bash
     cd ../evm-bridge-frontend
     npm install
     ```

---

## Configuration
1. **Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the **evm-bridge-backend** folder (and/or **evm-bridge-frontend** if needed) with the following keys:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your private key for deployment/testing>
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<Sepolia network RPC URL>
   BSC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=<BSC testnet RPC URL>
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<Optional, for contract verification>
   BSCSCAN_API_KEY=<Optional, for contract verification>
   ```
   Make sure not to commit your private keys to version control.

2. **Contract Addresses**  
   After deploying, update the frontend `.env` or config files with the addresses of **ETHBridge**, **BSCBridge**, **Donut**, and **WDonut** contracts.

---

## Deployment
1. **Compile Contracts**  
   ```bash
   cd evm-bridge-backend
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Deploy to Sepolia**  
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployEthBridge.ts --network sepolia
   ```
3. **Deploy to BSC Testnet**  
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployBscBridge.ts --network bsctest
   ```
4. **Verify Contracts (Optional)**  
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --network sepolia
   npx hardhat verify <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --network bsctest
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Run the Backend (Relayer)**  
   - Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured.  
   - Start the relayer or any backend service that listens for events:
     ```bash
     cd evm-bridge-backend
     npm run start:relayer
     ```
   This will watch for lock events on Sepolia or BSC testnet and relay them to the other chain.

2. **Start the Frontend**  
   ```bash
   cd ../evm-bridge-frontend
   npm start
   ```
   - This typically opens `http://localhost:3000` (or another port) in your browser.

3. **Bridge Flow**  
   - **Lock Donut → Mint WDonut**:  
     - On the origin chain (e.g., Sepolia), select how many **Donut** tokens you want to lock.  
     - The relayer listens for the lock event and mints **WDonut** on the destination chain (e.g., BSC testnet).  
     - Switch your wallet to the destination chain to see your newly minted **WDonut** tokens.  
   - **Burn WDonut → Unlock Donut**:  
     - On the destination chain, choose how many **WDonut** tokens you want to burn.  
     - The relayer will listen for the burn event and unlock the equivalent amount of **Donut** on the origin chain.

---

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**  
   ```bash
   cd evm-bridge-backend
   npx hardhat test
   ```
2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Make sure both networks are set up.  
   - Ensure you have test tokens on each chain.  
   - Run the test suite that checks bridging functionality end-to-end.
